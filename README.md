# PokéApp
A simple app to keep track of my favorite Pokémons

If you're getting a link to this repository it means that your profile was selected to the second stage of recruitment for Bereyziat Development. Congrats 🎉!
In this repository and in the following lines of the README.md you will find all the necessary information and resources to make your own version of PokéApp.

### What is the app?
PokéApp is a really simple iOS app that will allow users accross the world to keep track of their favorite Pokémons (For the moment it's in its Beta stage so please be consilent with its developers 😉).
PokéApp lists all the 1154 Pokémons from the PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/). It allows the users to scroll through this list and perform a search on the name of the Pokémon.
The user can also slide a given Pokémon in the list and access to a fav button. Once clicked, the pokemon disappears and get on top of the list. The top of the list is separated from the rest of the Pokémons by a simple separator line to allow the users to keep their favorite pokemon organised.

### Mock-ups
Here you can find a simple interactive mock-up of the app. Bulbasaur and Ditto (when it is in favorite) can be displayed. To see the fav button slide animation you can click on the sentence "Pokemon of type normal" (this is a limitation of the mock-up in reality the user will have to slide to display the button) -> Ditto is the only Pokémon with this button active on the mock-up but all Pokémons can be faved in the real app. (There is no search bar in the mock-up so you're free to integrate the search functionality as you want)

\<To get the mock-up read the following instructions\>

### What is my task exactly?
- To make this app you will have 1h.
- You are highly recommanded to target at least iOS 15 and use SwiftUI
- To start working on the project you can simply fork the pokeapp repository on your GitHub account (Fork the project only once you're ready to start coding). 
- Once you downloaded the repo on your Mac and your iOS project is set-up you can send an email to bereyziat.recruitment@gmail.com with "\<your firstname\> \<your lastname\>" as the mail subject and the link to your forked reporsitory in the body of the email. (Don't forget to put a little content in the body otherwise your mail will endup in the spam)
- You should automatically receive the mock-up link. (If you don't receive the link try to whitelist bereyziat.recruitment@gmail.com and send your email again otherwise let us know at the same email and we will sent it as soon as possible)
- The 1h timer starts when you receive the email so start your own timer and let's start coding!
- After 1 hour stop your work, commit your changes and push it to your repository

### Good to know
This task is not made to be finished in 1h - you will have to make compromises on some functionalities or some of the visual aspects. 
After your first 1h commit take your time to finish the task (don't spend more than 3h, as I said before PokéApp is still in Betâ so it doesn't have to be perfect 😉). You can now complete the following section of the README.md and make a second and final commit/push containing any work that you still wanted to implement.
-> Notify us that you're done by sending an email to bereyziat.recruitment@gmail.com with "\<your firstname\> \<your lastname\>" as the mail subject and the link to your forked reporsitory in the body of the email.

### I'm done! 😎
Great! Thanks for your work I'm sure that PokéFans around the world will be more than happy to use your new PokéApp version! Remains just for you to answer the following questions.

If you would have more time what would you still implement and how? (3-4 lines max)

Do you have any idea to make the PokéApp better? (2 main functionnalities and how would you implement them)

How did you enjoy working on such project?

What was the most difficult part to implement in this project?

Any comments? or questions? (concerning the task or the Junior iOS Developer Job)
